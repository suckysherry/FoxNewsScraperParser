New York state has now surpassed China in confirmed coronavirus cases, despite having more than a billion fewer residents.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday that there are now 83,712 patients with COVID-19 in the state, compared to China’s countrywide reported tally of 82,361. Yet China's decision to exclude people without symptoms from its official coronavirus count continues to raise questions about the actual number of infections there.
Cuomo said the number of deaths in New York state also has risen to 1,941, up from 1,550 yesterday.
“That number will continue to go up,” he added.

He also said New York City’s Police Department “has to get more aggressive” in enforcing social distancing. The Big Apple’s residents were widely criticized earlier this week after they gathered to watch the USNS Comfort ship sail up the Hudson River.
“How reckless and irresponsible and selfish for people not to do it on their own,” Cuomo said. “I mean what else do you have to know, what else do you have to hear, who else has to die for you to understand you have a responsibility in this?”
