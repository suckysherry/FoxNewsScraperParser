“The entire travel party, Nets organization right now, basketball operations department is symptom-free,” Marks told the newspaper. “I would say this is affecting a much bigger circle. I don’t know that any of us don’t know somebody who isn’t directly affected or has come down with it. That could be a family member or that could be just friends in the community or friends around the US and around the globe, so it’s definitely affecting everybody.”
