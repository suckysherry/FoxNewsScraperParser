Americans pulling together in a time of crisis is not new, but it is news. You can help Fox News share it.
Every day and in every community, the coronavirus pandemic is bringing out the best in Americans. Amid the frightening headlines and heartbreaking stories, there is inspiration and hope. Our health care workers are being recognized for the selfless heroes they are. Warehouse workers, truckers and supermarket employees have all answered the call to ensure the rest of us can get the provisions we need to survive these trying times. Businesses of all sizes are doing their best to keep their employees on the books in an uncertain economy. Families, neighbors and communities are pulling together to support those most in need.
Help Fox News show the best in America by sending us your photo demonstrating how everyday people throughout the United States are rising to the occasion to help loved ones, friends and strangers in our shared time of need. We’ll feature the best submissions every day on FoxNews.com.
