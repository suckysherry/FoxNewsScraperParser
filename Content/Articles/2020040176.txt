Troy Aikman filled the role at last weekend's virtual Texas race, impersonating a famous fellow statesman as he gave the "start your engines" command from his phone.
Gronk and Mojo will also appear remotely, as the whole point of the series is to provide some racing action while maintaining social distancing.
The Texas race drew 1.3 million viewers, setting a record for a televised esports event, and Sunday's race will take place on a digital version of Bristol Motor Speedway at 1 pm ET.
