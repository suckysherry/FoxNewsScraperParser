Padma Lakshmi danced her way through her 18th day of quarantine amid the coronavirus crisis.
The "Top Chef" host, 49, created a Tik Tok video inside of her home, grooving to Fleetwood Mac's "Dreams" and Doja Cat's "Candy."
"This took precisely 29 takes üòÇ ," Lakshmi captioned a video posted to her Instagram on Tuesday along with the hashtags #tiktoktrials #whatididforlove and #quarantinesoultrain.
