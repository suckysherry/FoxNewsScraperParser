Americans are curious if they will get benefits. If you get a check, how much should you expect? The Wall Street Journal's Richard Rubin joins the Rundown to break down who receives a check and who doesn't.
Also on the Rundown: The coronavirus pandemic has impacted many small businesses. The restaurant industry has been especially hard hit as many owners have been forced to close down their dining areas and only serve takeout because of social distancing.  This has left many restaurant workers unemployed and uncertain about when they can return to work. Restaurant owner and host of the Food Network series "Restaurant: Impossible" chef Robert Irvine weighs in on if restaurants will survive this and how they can possibly adapt to keep the outbreak from killing their businesses.
