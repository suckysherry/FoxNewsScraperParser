"This is scary, this is dangerous," Lunny said. "My best friend just lost her grandmother to covid-19. I have a mild case, luckily... but it makes me think about how many other people may have it and not even know. How many have it and dismiss it as allergies or just a cold.
"I have had worse flus than I have now," she continued. "But just because it’s mild in one person, doesn’t mean it couldn’t kill the next. So stay home. Watch a show. Wash your hands. Just be smart. Do your part to flatten the curve!"

See you all in a month ♥️😷 stay healthy xoxo.#corona #coronavirus #covid19 #flattenthecurve."
